# 🏠 Hyderabad House Rent Predictor

A simple and clean **machine learning mini-project** that predicts **monthly rent** for houses in Hyderabad based on area (sqft).  
Built completely **from scratch** using Python, NumPy, and Pandas — no sklearn, no shortcuts. Just the raw fundamentals. 💡

---

## 📌 What this project does:
- Cleans messy real-world data like `"1200-1500 sqft"` or `"2,400 sqft"`
- Handles missing/invalid values
- Implements **Linear Regression** using **manual gradient descent**
- Predicts rent based on user input
- Visualizes predictions with Matplotlib

---

## 🧠 Why it's awesome:
- Shows how machine learning works at the core
- Great for beginners who want to understand what's behind the magic
- No dependencies on big ML libraries — just logic & math

---
## 🚀 Sample Output:

Weight (w): 9.67
Bias (b): 1706.11
Enter area in sqft: 2000
Estimated Monthly Rent: ₹21349
